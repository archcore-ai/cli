title: "MCP Server Starts Without .archcore/ and Exposes init_project Tool"

## Context

Before this change, `archcore mcp` refused to start if `.archcore/` did not exist in the current working directory — the command returned `".archcore/ not found — run 'archcore init' first"` and exited. This meant that an AI coding agent configured to launch the Archcore MCP server on an uninitialized project could not help the user at all: the server process crashed on stdio before any tool call could be made, so the agent had no way to self-bootstrap the knowledge base.

Two user flows were affected:

1. **New project onboarding.** A user installs the Archcore plugin/MCP config into their agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) globally, then opens a fresh repo. The agent tries to use Archcore tools but the server keeps crashing until the user drops to a terminal and runs `archcore init`. Friction point — especially for users who installed the plugin globally and don't expect per-project shell setup.
2. **Agent-driven init.** There was no way for the agent itself to initialize Archcore in-session, even though it has full context about the project (language, sync preferences, etc.) and could sensibly call an initialization tool.

## Decision

1. **`archcore mcp` starts unconditionally.** The `.archcore/` existence check in `cmd/mcp.go` is removed. The server always boots on stdio and prints a hint in the startup banner when the directory is missing.
2. **Add an `init_project` MCP tool** (`internal/mcp/tools/init_project.go`). It creates `.archcore/` and writes `settings.json` from within the MCP server itself. It accepts `language`, `sync_mode`, and `archcore_url` and is idempotent — calling it on an already-initialized project returns the existing settings without overwriting them.
3. **Server instructions document the bootstrap flow.** The system prompt embedded in `internal/mcp/server.go` (`mcpServerInstructions`) explicitly tells the agent: "if `list_documents` returns empty AND the user wants to create documents, call `init_project` once, then proceed."
4. **Other tools continue to assume `.archcore/` exists.** `create_document`, `list_documents`, `update_document`, etc. are not changed to auto-init. The only tool safe to call on an uninitialized project is `init_project`.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Auto-init on any mutating tool call.** Rejected: makes the init contract implicit and fragile. If the user has not yet decided on sync mode, an auto-init would silently pick `none`, which is a product decision that should be explicit.
- **Keep the shell-only `archcore init` path and fail the MCP server loudly.** Rejected: defeats the whole point of MCP-first onboarding. The agent is exactly the right place to gather initialization preferences from the user conversationally.
- **Expose `archcore init` as a shell-out from the MCP server.** Rejected: couples the MCP server to subprocess execution and an installed CLI binary. `init_project` reuses the in-process `internal/config` helpers (`NewNoneSettings`, `InitDir`, `Save`) — no new code paths to maintain.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Zero-shell onboarding: installing the Archcore MCP config into an agent is enough to start using it in any repo.
- The server can be preconfigured in an agent plugin that targets *every* project by default, without breaking uninitialized projects.
- The init flow becomes conversational — the agent can ask the user about sync mode and language before calling the tool.

Negative / constraints:

- The MCP server now has a "degraded" mode (running, but most tools will fail). The startup banner's hint compensates, but agents that ignore system prompts may attempt `create_document` before `init_project` and see confusing errors. Mitigated by the explicit instruction block in `mcpServerInstructions`.
- `init_project` must stay idempotent. A regression that clobbers existing `settings.json` on the second call would destroy user configuration. Covered by `TestHandleInitProject_Idempotent`.
- Any future MCP tool that *also* safely works on an uninitialized project must be documented in the server instructions alongside `init_project`. Today that list is just `init_project`.
