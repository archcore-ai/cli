**Git-native context for AI coding agents**

Archcore helps teams turn scattered repo knowledge into structured context that AI coding agents can find, reuse, and follow.

> Context engineering for repositories.

AI coding agents start every session without project context. Your architecture decisions, coding conventions, postmortems, and implementation plans are scattered across docs, chats, and tool-specific files. Archcore gives your repo a structured context layer that agents can read and update.

## Why Archcore

- **Shared repo context** — keep architecture knowledge where code lives
- **Works across agents** — Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Roo Code, and Cline
- **Structured documents** — ADRs, RFCs, Rules, Guides, Plans, PRDs, incidents, and more
- **Git-native** — local-first, version-controlled, reviewable with code
- **MCP-powered** — agents can read, create, update, and link documents in real time
- **Built for teams** — context survives sessions, teammates, and tool changes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://archcore.ai/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
archcore init

# Validate setup
archcore doctor
```

After `archcore init`, Archcore creates a `.archcore/` directory in your repo and installs integrations so your coding assistant can read and manage project context.

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archcore.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

Download `archcore.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/archcore-ai/cli/releases/latest) and add it to your `PATH`.

```powershell
# Example: move to a directory in your PATH
Move-Item archcore.exe C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.local\bin\
```

### Windows (WSL)

Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), then run inside it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://archcore.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/archcore-ai/cli@latest
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/archcore-ai/cli.git
cd cli
go build -o archcore .
```

**Supported platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows — amd64 and arm64.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize your repo**  
   `archcore init` creates `.archcore/` and installs integrations for supported agents.

2. **Capture durable context**  
   Store architecture decisions, rules, plans, product docs, and incident learnings as structured Markdown files.

3. **Let agents reuse it**  
   Hooks and MCP let your coding agents read existing context and create or update documents during real work.

4. **Keep it in Git**  
   Review context changes like code, evolve them over time, and keep them portable across tools.

## What Lives in `.archcore/`

```text
.archcore/
├── settings.json
├── .sync-state.json
├── auth/
│   ├── jwt-strategy.adr.md
│   └── auth-redesign.prd.md
├── backend/
│   └── error-wrapping.rule.md
├── incidents/
│   └── connection-pool-exhaustion.cpat.md
└── notifications/
    └── notifications-implementation.plan.md
```

The structure is **free-form** — organize documents by domain, feature, team, or whatever fits your repo. Categories are virtual and inferred from the document type in the filename (`slug.type.md`).

Use `.archcore/` for:

- architecture decisions
- coding rules and conventions
- implementation plans
- product requirements
- incidents and postmortems
- reusable workflow knowledge

See the Archcore CLI repository itself for a working example: [`.archcore/` in this repo](https://github.com/archcore-ai/cli/tree/main/.archcore)

## Why Not Just Instruction Files?

Files like `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or repository instructions are useful, but they break down when your team needs:

- more than one flat memory file
- structured document types like ADRs, rules, plans, and incidents
- reusable context across multiple AI tools
- versioned project knowledge that grows with the codebase
- relations between documents, like a plan implementing a PRD
- incident learnings and recurring workflows that agents can reuse later

Archcore complements instruction files by giving your repo a structured context layer that agents can find, reuse, and follow.

## Try It

After `archcore init`, open your AI agent and start talking. The agent already knows your existing documents and has tools to create new ones.

> “We decided to use PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB for our primary database. Record this decision.”

Creates `infrastructure/use-postgres.adr.md` with context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences.

> “We have a team convention: always wrap errors with context using fmt.Errorf and %w. Make this a rule.”

Creates `backend/error-wrapping.rule.md` with imperative guidance, rationale, and good/bad code examples.

> “Last week we had a connection pool exhaustion incident because idle connections weren't being recycled. Document this so we don't repeat it.”

Creates `incidents/connection-pool-exhaustion.cpat.md` with root-cause analysis and prevention steps.

> “I need a PRD for the user notifications feature — push, email digests, and in-app alerts.”

Creates `notifications/user-notifications.prd.md` with goals, user stories, requirements, and success metrics.

> “Create an implementation plan for the notifications PRD and link them together.”

Creates `notifications/notifications-implementation.plan.md`, then links it to the PRD with an `implements` relation.

## Document Types

Archcore organizes context into 3 layers of knowledge: Vision, Knowledge, and Experience.

### Vision

| Type | Full Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `prd` | Product Requirements Document | Goals, user stories, acceptance criteria, and success metrics |
| `idea` | Idea | Lightweight capture of a product or technical idea for future exploration |
| `plan` | Plan | Phased task list with acceptance criteria and dependencies |

Archcore also supports two additional requirements tracks for teams that need structured discovery or formal decomposition:

**Sources track** (MRD → BRD → URD) — captures *where* requirements come from:

| Type | Full Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `mrd` | Market Requirements Document | Market landscape, TAM/SAM/SOM, competitive analysis, and market needs |
| `brd` | Business Requirements Document | Business objectives, stakeholders, ROI, and business rules |
| `urd` | User Requirements Document | User personas, journeys, usability requirements, and acceptance criteria |

**ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 track** (BRS → StRS → SyRS → SRS) — captures *how* requirements decompose:

| Type | Full Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `brs` | Business Requirements Specification | Mission, goals, objectives, and business operational concept |
| `strs` | Stakeholder Requirements Specification | Stakeholder needs, operational concept, and user requirements |
| `syrs` | System Requirements Specification | System functions, interfaces, performance, and design constraints |
| `srs` | Software Requirements Specification | Software functions, external interfaces, and detailed behavioral specs |

Use PRD for most projects. Add the sources track when you need structured requirement discovery. Add ISO 29148 when you need formal traceability for regulated or complex multi-team systems. Mix freely — some features can use a PRD while others use the full cascade.
### Knowledge

| Type | Full Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `adr` | Architecture Decision Record | Captures a finalized technical decision with context, alternatives, and consequences |
| `rfc` | Request for Comments | Proposes a significant change open for team review and feedback |
| `rule` | Rule | Coding or process standard with imperative guidance and examples |
| `guide` | Guide | Step-by-step instructions for completing a specific task |
| `doc` | Document | Reference documentation, registries, and descriptive material |
| `spec` | Specification | Canonical normative contract for a system, component, interface, or protocol |

### Experience

| Type | Full Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `task-type` | Task Type | Reusable checklist and workflow for a recurring task |
| `cpat` | Code Change Pattern | Root-cause analysis of a bug or incident with prevention steps |

Each document is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Use PostgreSQL for Primary Storage"
status: draft
---

## Context
...
```

Valid statuses: `draft`, `accepted`, and `rejected`.

## Document Relations

Documents can be linked with directed relations to other documents:

- **related** — general association
- **implements** — source implements what target specifies
- **extends** — source builds upon target
- **depends_on** — source requires target to proceed

Relations are stored in `.sync-state.json` and managed automatically by the AI agent through MCP tools.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `archcore init` | Initialize `.archcore/` directory interactively |
| `archcore doctor` | Check your archcore setup and fix issues |
| `archcore status` | Check .archcore/ structure and document health |
| `archcore config` | View or modify settings |
| `archcore hooks install` | Install hooks for detected AI agents |
| `archcore update` | Update Archcore to the latest version |
| `archcore mcp` | Run the MCP stdio server |
| `archcore mcp install` | Install MCP config for detected agents |

### Update

```bash
# Update to the latest version
archcore update
```

The command checks GitHub Releases for a newer version, downloads it, verifies the SHA-256 checksum, and atomically replaces the current binary.

### Examples

```bash
# Install integrations for a specific agent
archcore hooks install --agent cursor
archcore mcp install --agent gemini-cli
```

## AI Agent Integration

Archcore integrates with AI coding agents in two ways:

- **Hooks** inject context at session start, so the agent is aware of your `.archcore/` documents from the first message.
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) gives the agent tools to list, read, create, update, and link documents in real time.

### Supported Agents

| Agent | Hooks | MCP |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Claude Code | yes | yes |
| Cursor | yes | yes |
| Gemini CLI | yes | yes |
| GitHub Copilot | yes | yes |
| OpenCode | — | yes |
| Codex CLI | — | yes |
| Roo Code | — | yes |
| Cline | — | manual |

### Install Integrations

```bash
# Auto-detect agents in your project and install everything
archcore hooks install

# Or target a specific agent
archcore mcp install --agent opencode
```

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `.archcore/settings.json` and created during `archcore init`.

| Field | Description | Values |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `sync` | Sync mode. Cloud and on-prem are coming soon. | `none` (local only), `cloud`, `on-prem` |
| `language` | Document language. Helps the agent generate documentation in the right language. | String, defaults to `en` |

```bash
archcore config                              # show all settings
archcore config get <key>                    # get a specific value
archcore config set <key> <value>            # set a value
```
